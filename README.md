# VoronoiDiagramResearch
This is the source code to my undergraduate research project for GVSU's Student Scholar's Day in Spring of 2024. I worked with Professor Byron DeVries to build a program that creates heatmaps based on the availability of amenities (schools, grocery stores, etc.) in Grand Rapids. 

Through this program, we were able to come to fascinating conclusions regarding the various districts' amenity access, drawing ties to the areas' histories, wealth, and personalized needs. 

To run the program, just install the needed packages and run main. The program can run a heatmap/diagram on a single type of amenety, or run a weighted heatmap by setting different multipliers on the seed sets.
